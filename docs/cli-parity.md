# CLI parity contract

Go is the behavioral reference. Node.js and Python must expose the same public
commands unless an exception is listed below.

Supported runtimes: Go 1.25+, Node.js 18+, and Python 3.10+.

## AI integration lifecycle

The Go, Node.js, and Python runtimes expose the same public lifecycle:

```bash
trackfw agents list|install|uninstall|update
trackfw skills list|install|uninstall|update
```

The common flags are `--targets`, `--items`, `--scope`, `--surface`, `--json`,
and, for mutations that may replace or remove content, `--force`. Mutations
without `--targets` open a TTY selector; in non-interactive execution the flag
is required. Supported targets are Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity,
Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Amazon Q, and Kiro.

Lifecycle state is one of `not-installed`, `current`, `outdated`, or `modified`.
Ownership and SHA-256 are stored per project or global scope. Update and
uninstall preserve modified files unless `--force` is explicit; uninstall never
removes an unmanaged file or a shared artifact that still has another claim.
Legacy surfaces are inspected by `list` and selected explicitly for mutations,
for example `--surface antigravity=legacy-cli`. Known legacy templates can be
adopted safely; unknown content is never adopted by `update`, even with force.

The standalone `gemini`, `cursor`, `copilot`, `windsurf`, and `amazonq` names
exist only in the Go distribution for historical compatibility. They are not
part of the cross-runtime contract; use `agents` and `skills` in new automation.

## Agent identity

Agent identity is a cross-runtime contract, not a per-distribution feature. The
Go, Node.js, and Python CLIs read the **same** configuration file and must
produce the same artifact bytes for the same input.

### Shared configuration

```
~/.trackfw/identity.json
```

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "user_nickname": "Kleber",
  "agents": {
    "architect": { "display_name": "Zeus", "slug": "zeus" }
  }
}
```

The file is global — it is **not** mirrored per scope. Identity is a user
preference, not project state, so the same file applies to both `global` and
`project` scopes and to every repository on the machine. `schema_version` must
be `1`; any other value is an error in all three runtimes. A missing file, an
empty `agents` map, or a missing entry for a given agent `id` produces the
current default output **byte for byte** — the feature is opt-in and cannot
regress an existing installation.

Identity is materialized at install time by the render pipeline and written
into the artifact. The agent never reads the configuration at runtime.

The canonical agent `id` (`architect`, `backend`, …) and the installation path
(`trackfw-{{id}}`) are unaffected by identity. Only the `name` and
`description` frontmatter fields and the first line of the body change. The
`name` always carries the fixed `-tf` suffix (`zeus` → `zeus-tf`), which
prevents silent shadowing of a personal agent that happens to use the same
name.

### Slug contract

1. **Preset slugs are hardcoded.** Every themed preset ships an explicit
   `display_name`/`slug` pair. Slugs are never derived at runtime, so the three
   runtimes cannot diverge through differences in Unicode normalization
   (`Ártemis` → `artemis` is a table entry, not a computation).
2. **Dynamic slugification is used only in `custom` mode**, where the user
   types the ten names freely. The algorithm is identical in all three
   runtimes: NFD decomposition + diacritic removal (ASCII-fold), lowercase,
   `[ _]` → `-`, discard of every character outside `[a-z0-9-]`, collapse of
   repeated `-`, trim of leading and trailing `-`.
3. **Invalid input is rejected with an error, never silently corrected.** A
   value that normalizes to the empty string, or that exceeds 40 characters,
   fails. Two agents resolving to the same slug also fail.

### Shared test fixture

The slug vectors live in a single fixture replicated **byte-identically** in
the three packages:

| Runtime | Path |
|---|---|
| Go | `internal/identity/testdata/slug_vectors.json` |
| Node.js | `npm/tests/fixtures/slug_vectors.json` |
| Python | `pypi/tests/fixtures/slug_vectors.json` |

It covers accents, uppercase, spaces, repeated separators, emoji, the empty
string, and the over-length case. Each suite consumes the fixture directly;
adding a vector in one runtime without propagating it is a contract break.

### Parity gate

`scripts/check-identity-parity.sh` is the cross-CLI gate for this contract. It
verifies that the three `slug_vectors.json` copies are byte-identical and that
the three runtimes render the same artifact for the same `identity.json`.
It runs as part of `make quality`, alongside `check-cli-parity.sh` and
`check-integration-assets.sh`.

### The wizard's UX is also part of the contract

Identity is not only configured by `init` — `trackfw agents install` offers
the same interactive wizard, and the two entry points must feel identical
across the three CLIs. Specifically:

- **Order of steps** — targets → agents → surface → nickname → preset or
  custom → names (custom only) → confirmation → install.
- **Trigger rule** — the wizard appears in `agents install` only when
  `kind == agents` **and** stdin is a TTY **and** (`identity.json` is absent
  **or** `--identity` was passed). `skills install` never triggers it, and a
  non-interactive run never blocks on a prompt.
- **Confirmation screen content** — before any write, the ten
  `specialty → name` pairs plus the nickname, for preset and custom alike;
  declining returns to preset selection without persisting anything.
- **Custom-mode labels** — each field shows `Item.Name` + `Item.Description`
  from the catalog (e.g. `Architect — Architecture, ADRs and governed
  coordination`), never the raw `id`.

Unlike the artifact bytes and the slug algorithm, this UX contract has **no
automated cross-CLI test** yet — `check-identity-parity.sh` validates the
generated artifacts, not the wizard's interactive flow. Parity here is
maintained by review: a change to the wizard's steps, labels, trigger rule,
or confirmation layout in one CLI must be ported to the other two in the same
change.

## Release rule

Changes to commands, options, exit codes, JSON fields, validation rules, or
generated artifact semantics require equivalent tests in all affected runtimes.

`internal/serve/static` is the canonical dashboard asset source. Copies packaged
by npm and PyPI must remain byte-identical and are checked in CI.

Plugin downloads use timeouts, size limits, and atomic replacement. Registry
entries do not currently publish checksums; adding signed SHA-256 metadata is a
required compatibility change before checksum verification can become mandatory.
